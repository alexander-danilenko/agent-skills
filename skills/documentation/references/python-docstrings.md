# Python Docstrings

Uses Microsoft contract-first conventions: a docstring describes **what** a callable does and **why** — the contract — not how it works inside. Implementation detail belongs in `#` comments in the body, never in the docstring.

## Bare Minimum — Do Not Restate the Signature

Type hints are part of the signature. Given `def calculate_total(items: list[Item], tax_rate: float = 0.0) -> float`, the reader already sees every name, every type, the default, and the return type. The docstring adds only what those cannot carry: intent, units, ranges, the meaning of edge values, what `None` or an empty result signifies, and which exceptions escape.

Because the annotations carry the types, **do not repeat them in the docstring.** Drop the `(float)` / `: float` type echoes that older NumPy and Sphinx snippets show, and drop any `Args:` entry whose text only re-says the parameter name.

```python
# WRONG — every line restates the signature.
def find_user(user_id: str) -> User | None:
    """Find a user by id.

    Args:
        user_id: The user's id, as a string.

    Returns:
        The user object, or None.
    """

# CORRECT — only the non-obvious contract is documented.
def find_user(user_id: str) -> User | None:
    """Find a user by id.

    Returns:
        None when no user matches; the lookup never raises on a miss.
    """
```

### When an `Args:` Entry Earns Its Keep

Document a parameter only when the text answers something the annotation cannot:

- What unit is it in? (ms, bytes, a decimal fraction, …)
- What range or clamp applies?
- What default behaviour applies when it is omitted?
- What does an edge value mean? (`0` disables, `-1` = unlimited, empty list = "all", …)
- What does `None` or an empty value signify, versus raising?

If none apply, omit the entry — a name-and-type echo is noise. `Raises:` is the opposite default: document it whenever the function can raise, because the exception set is invisible from the signature.

```python
def next_delay(attempt: int) -> float:
    """Compute the exponential backoff delay.

    Args:
        attempt: Zero-based; values above 10 are clamped.

    Returns:
        Delay in seconds, capped at 30.
    """
```

`attempt` earns its `Args:` line because "zero-based" and the clamp are not in `int`. `Returns:` earns its line because the unit (seconds) and the cap are not in `float`.

## Length Budget

PEP 257 already asks for a one-line summary on the line that opens the docstring, and the budget below is that rule made explicit for the rest of the block:

- **Summary — exactly one line**, ending in a period, directly after `"""`.
- **Detail — three lines at most**, after a blank line, carrying primary ideas only.
- **Inline `#` comments — three lines at most, one preferred.**

Branch-by-branch behaviour and the reasoning behind a constraint go under `Note:` (Google), `Notes` (NumPy), or `.. note::` (Sphinx), so the opening of the docstring stays readable.

Measure after the formatter. Black and Ruff do not reflow docstring prose, so the check is against the project's configured width (`line-length` in `pyproject.toml`, `max-line-length` in flake8 config, `.editorconfig`) — a summary that pushes past it must lose words, not gain a second line.

```python
# WRONG — the summary runs to a second line, and the detail is branch notes.
def acquire(self, timeout: float | None = None) -> Connection:
    """Acquire a pooled connection, waiting for a free slot when the pool
    is saturated, and record pool pressure for the metrics sink.

    When the pool is empty the caller queues in FIFO order. When the queue
    is also full the call raises immediately. When a slot frees, the oldest
    waiter wins it. Health checks run before the connection is handed back.
    """

# CORRECT — one summary line, detail within three, branches under Note:.
def acquire(self, timeout: float | None = None) -> Connection:
    """Acquire a pooled connection, queueing when the pool is saturated.

    Waiters are served FIFO, and every connection is health-checked before
    it reaches the caller, so an acquire can outlast the idle timeout.

    Note:
        The queue is bounded: once it is full, acquire raises rather than
        waiting, which keeps a stalled upstream from consuming the pool.
    """
```

## Styles Differ in Syntax, Not in Discipline

Pick one style per project. They lay the sections out differently; the bare-minimum rule applies to all three, and with type hints present none of them repeat the type.

### Google Style (Recommended)

```python
def calculate_total(items: list[Item], tax_rate: float = 0.0) -> float:
    """Calculate the order total, tax included.

    Args:
        tax_rate: Decimal fraction; 0.08 is 8%. Defaults to no tax.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If tax_rate is negative or items is empty.
    """
```

`items` has no `Args:` entry — the name and `list[Item]` say everything. `tax_rate` keeps one for the unit and default behaviour. `Returns:` is omitted because the summary already states the result.

### NumPy Style

```python
def calculate_total(items: list[Item], tax_rate: float = 0.0) -> float:
    """Calculate the order total, tax included.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tax_rate
        Decimal fraction; 0.08 is 8%. Defaults to no tax.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If tax_rate is negative or items is empty.
    """
```

No `tax_rate : float` type line — the annotation carries the type.

### Sphinx Style

```python
def calculate_total(items: list[Item], tax_rate: float = 0.0) -> float:
    """Calculate the order total, tax included.

    :param tax_rate: Decimal fraction; 0.08 is 8%. Defaults to no tax.
    :raises ValueError: If tax_rate is negative or items is empty.
    """
```

Drop the `:type:` and `:rtype:` fields entirely when type hints are present.

## Class Documentation

Document what the class is for. Do not re-document a constructor parameter on both the class `Attributes:` block and `__init__` — that is the same DRY rule the interface/implementation split enforces elsewhere. Give the constructor a docstring only when its arguments need meaning beyond their names; otherwise omit it.

```python
class UserService:
    """Manage the user lifecycle, backed by a write-through cache.

    Reads are served from the cache; writes update both stores.
    """

    def __init__(self, db: AsyncSession, cache: Redis) -> None: ...
```

The class summary earns its keep by naming a behaviour the class name does not reveal — the write-through cache. `db` and `cache` get no `Args:` block; their names and types are self-explanatory, and the cache's role is stated once, on the class.

## Data Classes — Describe WHAT

A `dataclass`, `NamedTuple`, `TypedDict`, or Pydantic model that exists to _hold_ data answers what each field **is** — its meaning, units, format, and constraints the annotation can't carry — not **why** the field exists. Keep the `Attributes:` block to the _what_; design rationale belongs with the behavior that produces or consumes the value, not on the field.

```python
@dataclass
class ShippingAddress:
    """A postal destination for an order.

    Attributes:
        postal_code: ZIP or ZIP+4; validated against the country's format.
        country: ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code, uppercase.
    """

    postal_code: str
    country: str
```

`postal_code` and `country` each state what the value is and the constraint the type can't express — not why an address is stored.

## Examples Belong in Tests

Ship a doctest only when it is run — via `pytest --doctest-modules` or a doctest CI step. A doctest that is never executed drifts and misleads exactly like any other stale comment, so when an example would not be run, leave it out.

```python
def slugify(text: str) -> str:
    """Convert text to a URL-safe slug.

    Example:
        >>> slugify("Hello, World!")
        'hello-world'
    """
```

Keep the `Example:` block only when that doctest runs in the suite.
